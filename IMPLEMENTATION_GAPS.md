# ClustR Implementation Gap Analysis

Based on the provided UI mockups and current codebase analysis, here are the key features that need to be implemented:

## 1. MAINTENANCE MODULE - HIGH PRIORITY

### Current State:
- ✅ Basic `AddMaintenanceForm.vue` component exists

- ❌ No maintenance table with filtering/sorting

### Required Implementation:

#### A. Maintenance Dashboard Page (`pages/maintenance.vue`)
- Bar chart showing maintenance requests over time (12-month view)
- KPI cards showing: Completed, In Progress, Pending counts
- Status indicators with color coding
- Filter controls (date range, status, priority)

#### B. Maintenance Data Table
- Sortable columns: Title, Description, Priority, Assigned To, Due Date, Status
- Status badges with appropriate colors (green=completed, yellow=in-progress, red=overdue)
- Row actions (edit, delete, view details)
- Pagination support
- Search/filter functionality

#### C. Maintenance Types & Equipment Management
- Equipment catalog with maintenance schedules
- Maintenance type definitions (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, etc.)
- Recurring maintenance scheduling
- Asset tracking integration

## 2. PORTAL/CHAT MODULE - HIGH PRIORITY

### Current State:
- ✅ Chat components exist (`ConversationList`, `MessageThread`, `MessageComposer`)

- ❌ No main portal page layout
- ❌ No chat integration with main app
- ❌ No file attachment handling
- ❌ No real-time messaging

### Required Implementation:

#### A. Portal Main Page (`pages/portal.vue`)

- Search functionality across conversations

#### B. Chat Features
- Real-time messaging (WebSocket integration)
- Message reactions and replies
- File upload with drag-and-drop
- Message history pagination

- Show confirmation for chat actions## 3.
 SIDEBAR NAVIGATION - MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Current State:

- ❌ Organization name not dynamic
- ❌ Settings button missing

### Required Implementation:

#### A. Logo and Branding
- Replace generic icon with ClustR logo
- Dynamic organization name display
- Consistent branding across app

#### B. Navigation Enhancements
- Settings page and navigation
- User profile section
- Module access based on permissions
- Collapsible sidebar option

## 4. DATA VISUALIZATION - MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Current State:
- ✅ `SimpleBarChart.vue` component exists
- ✅ Basic KPI component structure
- ❌ No integration with real data
- ❌ Limited chart types

### Required Implementation:

#### A. Enhanced Charts
- Interactive bar charts with hover details
- Time-based filtering (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Export functionality (PDF, Excel)
- Responsive design for mobile

#### B. Dashboard Analytics

## 5. MISSING PAGES & ROUTES

### Required Pages:
- `/maintenance` - Main maintenance dashboard
- `/portal` - Communication portal
- `/settings` - Application settings
- `/profile` - User profile management
- `/reports` - Analytics and reporting

### Page Structure Needed:
```
pages/
├── maintenance/
│   ├── index.vue (dashboard)
│   ├── [id].vue (maintenance detail)
│   └── create.vue (new maintenance)
├── portal/
│   ├── index.vue (chat interface)
│   └── settings.vue (chat settings)
├── settings/
│   ├── index.vue (general settings)
│   ├── users.vue (user management)
│   └── permissions.vue (role management)
└── reports/
    ├── index.vue (reports dashboard)
    └── maintenance.vue (maintenance reports)
```

## 6. COMPONENT GAPS

### Missing UI Components:
- File upload with preview
- Advanced data tables with sorting/filtering
- Chart components (beyond basic bar chart)
- Modal dialogs for confirmations
- Toast notifications
- Loading states and skeletons

### Component Enhancements Needed:
- Make existing components more reusable
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error handling
- Add accessibility features## 7.
 BACKEND INTEGRATION

### Current State:
- ✅ Basic auth composables exist
- ✅ Module structure in place
- ❌ No API integration for maintenance data
- ❌ No real-time chat backend
- ❌ No file upload handling

### Required Implementation:
- REST API endpoints for maintenance CRUD
